## Single Image Reflection Removal through Cascaded Refinement
- Research Question

  How to remove reflection removal from a single image by a cascaded refinement approach?

- Motivation

1. Inspired by iterative structure reduction for hidden community detection in social networks. In single image reflection removal problem, the transmission layer is the strong and dominant structure while the refelction layer is weak and hidden which is similar with the principle in hidden community detection.
